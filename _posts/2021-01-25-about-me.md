I am a biochemistry student at Christopher Newport University. My current goal is to graduate with a bachelor’s degree from CNU, then attend graduate school at Virginia Commonwealth University and graduate with a master’s degree in Pharmacology. My ultimate goal with my degree would be to enter the field of research with a hospital or private company and research/develop medicines that could potentially cure diseases or severe illnesses.

Even though I aspire to be a future pharmacologist, I have not volunteered for any internship/volunteering opportunities. However, I have volunteered for multiple community events with my church, feeding the homeless and giving back to the community. Even though not many advances have been made for my occupation or my personal goals, I still strive to try my hardest and continue to grow and excel in everything that I do.

There are two businesses that I have done some work for, called _Joel Atanacio Photography_ and _A16Coding_. I have done bookkeeping and record keeping for both companies and as such, have acquired some useful skills for accounting. Both of these companies have given me the opportunity to learn more skills that could help me acquire a job in the future when I need it. 
Some examples of a platform where I would **love** to publish scientific journals or revolutionary medicinal research would be _The Journal of Consumer Research_ and _Nature Methods_. 
Regardless of lack of volunteering or personal experience, I would consider myself an extremely hardworking individual, who happens to be very quick to learn new skills and tricks that could benefit myself, but mostly others. 
I was born in Newark, NJ but have been living in Glen Allen, VA since 2014. I have a loving family, mainly consisting of my parents, my younger sister, and my dog.
