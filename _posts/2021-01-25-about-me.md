## About me
by Bryan Atanacio

I am a biochemistry student at Christopher Newport University. My current goal is to graduate with a bachelor’s degree from CNU, then attend graduate school at Virginia Commonwealth University and graduate with a master’s degree in Pharmacology. My ultimate goal with my degree would be to enter the field of research with a hospital or private company and research/develop medicines that could potentially cure diseases or severe illnesses. 
	Even though I aspire to be a future pharmacologist, I have not volunteered for any internship/volunteering opportunities. However, I have volunteered for multiple community events with my church, feeding the homeless and giving back to the community. Even though not many advances have been made for my occupation or my personal goals, I still strive to try my hardest and continue to grow and excel in everything that I do.

I have a loving family, mainly consisting of my parents, my younger sister, and my dog.
