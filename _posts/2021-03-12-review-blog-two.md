### Summary
_The Digital Dead Sea Scrolls_ is a DH project that allows people from all over the world to get the chance to analyze and examine ancient religious text of the Jewish faith. The production of this project was the collective effort of the Israel Museum and their partnership with Google. _The Digital Dead Sea Scrolls_ contain many of the Dead Seas Scrolls in a digital format. The project directors’ goal for the project was to find a way to expand upon the knowledge and accessibility of the Dead Sea Scrolls through a digital medium to the general audience.

### Design Methods
The exact project site design was not available anywhere throughout the project. However, the usage of the design tools helped to better optimize the readers experience on laptop and desktop devices, rather than mobile devices such as cellphones and tablets. The site allows for the reader to hover over a specific instances of text, which enables the reader to better analyze and interpret the religious history of the Israeli people.

### Importance
The DH project does a great job at utilizing a technological platform to better enhance the viewer's experience with such an ancient piece of text and culture. I can see that the directors took great pride and joy into designing this project for the public to see. The information presented with the texts not only translates what the text is saying, but also helps provide historical, cultural, and regional context behind why these ancient scrolls were written. The directors offer a form of contact within their site to ask any questions or give feedback on the project.

### Credentials
This project was jumpstarted in large part to Google, as they teamed up with the Israel Museum to create this DH project. Every image, video, and piece of information was given to the public by the Israel Museum while Google had a large part in developing the website itself.

### Review
_The Digital Dead Sea Scrolls_ does a great job of fusing the historical context of the Israeli culture and religion with the DH presentation for the general audience. This project has many pros and many cons to its design and functionality that both enhance and slightly take me out of the experience.
At the “Home Page”, it lays out the several available Dead Sea Scrolls that have been digitized as well as an introductory video to the Israel Museum and their goals for the website. I prefer overly simplistic, yet functional design work from these types of sites and _The Digital Dead Sea Scrolls_ definitely delivers in that regard. A separate video was within every Dead Sea Scroll entry on the site, and it showed the physical scrolls in the Israel Museum for each individual scroll.

However, an issue that I ran into when exploring that aspect of the project was that the videos were extremely short (within 1 minute 30 seconds), showed the physical scrolls for about 5 seconds each, and the museum curator that was talking during the videos kept explaining how each scroll will be digitized so more people can view them. Overall, the videos felt very formulaic and stale whenever I went from one to the next. Having one video to represent all of them could be a possible solution to that issue.

Another small issue I ran into was when I attempted to test the search feature on the website. Whenever I tried to search for anything on the project, the screen went all white and the text “Loading” appeared on screen, but never referenced me to anything on the site. For how small of a website, it was, I do not believe that a search feature was quite necessary and could likely be removed to avoid any confusion.

Within each separate scroll page, was a large wall of text that explained the historical and religious context behind each scroll. I very much enjoyed reading about all the history behind the scrolls, but having an image or timeline to better represent the era which the scroll were written may better enhance the viewer experience. I struggled to read through the text of each scroll in one sitting, so applying a timeline may be a better alternative to a simple wall of text.

Regardless of all the issues, the website does not have a complicated design, allowing virtually anyone to come and enjoy the project to the fullest. I applaud the efforts of the directors to develop such an interesting project that can provide so much information about a culture and religion that is still active today.
