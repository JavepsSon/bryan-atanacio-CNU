## Summary
The Digital Dead Sea Scrolls is a DH project that allows people from all over the world to get the chance to analyze and examine ancient religious text of the Jewish faith. The production of this project was the collective effort of the Israel Museum and their partnership with Google. The Digital Dead Sea Scrolls contain many of the Dead Seas Scrolls in a digital format. The project directors’ goal for the project was to find a way to expand upon the knowledge and accessibility of the Dead Sea Scrolls through a digital medium to the general audience.

## Design Methods
The exact project site design was not available anywhere throughout the project. However, the usage of the design tools helped to better optimize the readers experience on laptop and desktop devices, rather than mobile devices such as cellphones and tablets. The site allows for the reader to hover over a specific instances of text, which enables the reader to better analyze and interpret the religious history of the Israeli people.

## Review
The Digital Dead Sea Scrolls does a great job of fusing the historical context of the Israeli culture and religion with the DH presentation for the general audience. This project has many pros and many cons to its design and functionality that both enhance and slightly take me out of the experience.
At the “Home Page”, it lays out the several available Dead Sea Scrolls that have been digitized as well as an introductory video to the Israel Museum and their goals for the website. I prefer overly simplistic, yet functional design work from these types of sites and The Digital Dead Sea Scrolls definitely delivers in that regard. A separate video was within every Dead Sea Scroll entry on the site, and it showed the physical scrolls in the Israel Museum for each individual scroll.

However, an issue that I ran into when exploring that aspect of the project was that the videos were extremely short (within 1 minute 30 seconds), showed the physical scrolls for about 5 seconds each, and the museum curator that was talking during the videos kept explaining how each scroll will be digitized so more people can view them. Overall, the videos felt very formulaic and stale whenever I went from one to the next. Having one video to represent all of them could be a possible solution to that issue.
Another small issue I ran into was when I attempted to test the search feature on the website. Whenever I tried to search for anything on the project, the screen went all white and the text “Loading” appeared on screen, but never referenced me to anything on the site. For how small of a website, it was, I do not believe that a search feature was quite necessary and could likely be removed to avoid any confusion.
