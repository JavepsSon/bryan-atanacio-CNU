# My First Experience in TEI Coding

I was given a piece of a historical literature called **"The Yellow Wall-paper"** by Charlotte Perkins Stetson to code using TEI, or Text Encoding Initiative. Using Oxygen, I was able to digitize and code sections 8-11 of **The Yellow Wall-paper**.

As a class, we simultaneously began to translate the text from a Google Document into the Oxygen coding program and used the commenting feature of Google Documents to notate all specific instances of paragraphs, em-dashes, strikethoughs, etc.. For my section of text, I had many instances of single line paragraphs and additional spacing between words.I was tasked with the area of the text that had the most descriptive features of the wall and the main protagonist describing her daily living trapped indoors, due to her "mental illness". I felt that the way that I coded the text into Oxygen, the main themes of the story shined through.

There was a period of time where the class was allowed to request assistance in troubleshooting for the coding program, but I did not find the coding process to be terribly difficult. I had seen my father work on coding for several websites in the past, so I had some experience with the process before. Even so, working with the code in a personal way, it was a little intimidating but I was able to quickly get the hang of it. The main reason why I was slightly intimidated by Oxygen was because it had so many different way and methods with which someone can start coding. However, once the appropriate coding format was selected, the rest of the process was fairly simple. It all made sense to me in the end, as I ended up developing a good flow for the coding process.

The idea of coding was never something that I saw myself getting into, but with the little bit of experience that I have acquired using Oxygen, I think that if I tried to excel in this field, I would know enough to continue developing my skills. I would say that I am a quick learner in any area of study, but I would say that Oxugen probably holds the record for the fastest time I had spent learning a new skill.

The only part I even struggled with figuring out whether or not to add a paragraph break at the end of a sentence that bled into the next section. I later figured out that I did not have to since the end of a section is not the same as the end of a paragraph.

I wholeheartedly enjoyed the entire process of translating and transcribing physical documentation to a digital form and I am proud of the new skill that I have acquired. I never would have thought that this process would be fun, but to me it felt like a relaxing puzzle that I could do in my spare time without giving it too much thought. The only exception being when I ever make a major mistake in the code and I need to spend two hours figuring out what went wrong. Thankfully, almost no mistakes were made in the making of this code.

Overall, I enjoyed this digital humanities project. I learned to be diligent when creating code and to constantly check the code to make sure that it validates itself. If I was ever told to use this software again to help in another DH project, I would be more than glad to participate and learn evern more than I have already learned now.
