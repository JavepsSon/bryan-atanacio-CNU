### **Project**: **_Placing Segregation_**

### Project Directors: Dr. Robert C. Shephard, et al.

## Summary

_Placing Segregation_ is a journey through the 1860s-70s in the three major cities of Washington, Omaha, and Nashville. Dr. Shephard has dedicated time and extremely accurate historical census data to better study, understand, and preserve the culture of multiple minority group communities. Through extensive research into the historical census data of early America, Dr. Shephard and his associates have gathered information about every person within those three major city areas including occupation, age, gender, et.. The directors’ purpose for the project is to create a resource for historical inquiry that enables immediate analysis of the particular areas of interest. 

## Design Methods

The project site design was built using coding languages of HTML, CSS, Javascript and text-based GeoJSON, and the library Leaflet.js. The usage of these tools optimizes the reader's experience on laptops, desktop computer devices, and mobile devices such as cellphones and tablets. The site allows for the reader to view and analyze three major communities in a digital format that help them feel like they are in the 1860s-70s era.

## Importance

The project does an excellent job of utilizing historical documentation and technology to better analyze the recorded census of the time period. The project’s director is proficient in the field of geography and historical record-keeping, two areas of expertise that make up core of the project’s findings. The information presented within these maps shows the level of research about the topic by presenting accurate historical data that traces back several decades within an interactive map. The directors offer contact information in which you can get into contact with them about further research and questions on the project.

## Credentials

In its Methods section, the project quotes having been reviewed and published in the inaugural issued of SX Archipelagos, a digital wing of the Small Axe Project. They credit funding jointly to the Franklin Humanities Institute and the Form for Scholars and Publics. Images and other visual aids were provided by the Rubenstein Rare Book & Manuscript Library at Duke University. Music samples and notations of Hans Sloane were contributed by Rich Rath, via his musical library EthnoDigital Sonics Meets Maker Culture in Seventeenth-Century Jamaica.

## Review

Placing Segregation does an excellent job of merging history and technology in a user-friendly way. I enjoyed exploring the musical works and images on the pages and how flawlessly the site moved through its design. It made great use of subsections (Explore, Read, and About) but could’ve benefited from grouping the larger passages of texts with subheadings so the reader was better informed on what they were reading. On the Explore tab, the images are interactive but a legend containing the instructions on what the reader is viewing, what to click on, and what parts of the page are interactive would be very useful.

All three maps work well on laptops, desktop computer devices, 

Overall, the project is well informed and put together. I feel as though it does a great job of teaching one about the musical influences enslaved peoples had on history both abroad and in the New World.
