## Summary

Placing Segregation is an exploration of Englishman and physician, Hans Sloane’s discoveries while traveling to and living in Jamaica in the 1700s. His dedication to the study and preservation of the numerous cultures he explored over his twenty years of travel lead to the publication of his own book. The book and its subsequent volumes contain his findings of Caribbean history, engravings, ecology, and wildlife. The project directors’ aim for the project is to introduce the reader to some of the first known and earliest transcriptions of music which were created and performed by African slaves and survivors of the Middle Passage.

## Design Methods

The project site design was built using coding languages of HTML, CSS, Javascript and text-based GeoJSON, and the library Leaflet.js. The usage of these tools optimizes the reader's experience on laptops, desktop computer devices, and mobile devices such as cellphones and tablets. The site allows for the reader to view and analyze three major communities in a digital format that help them feel like they are in the 1860s-70s era.

## Importance

The project does an excellent job of utilizing historical documentation and technology to better analyze the recorded census of the time period. The project’s director is proficient in the field of geography and historical record-keeping, two areas of expertise that make up core of the project’s findings. The information presented within these maps shows the level of research about the topic by presenting accurate historical data that traces back several decades within an interactive map. The directors offer contact information in which you can get into contact with them about further research and questions on the project.

## Credentials

In its Methods section, the project quotes having been reviewed and published in the inaugural issued of SX Archipelagos, a digital wing of the Small Axe Project. They credit funding jointly to the Franklin Humanities Institute and the Form for Scholars and Publics. Images and other visual aids were provided by the Rubenstein Rare Book & Manuscript Library at Duke University. Music samples and notations of Hans Sloane were contributed by Rich Rath, via his musical library EthnoDigital Sonics Meets Maker Culture in Seventeenth-Century Jamaica.

## Review

Placing Segregation does an excellent job of merging history and technology in a user-friendly way. I enjoyed exploring the musical works and images on the pages and how flawlessly the site moved through its design. It made great use of subsections (Explore, Read, and About) but could’ve benefited from grouping the larger passages of texts with subheadings so the reader was better informed on what they were reading. On the Explore tab, the images are interactive but a legend containing the instructions on what the reader is viewing, what to click on, and what parts of the page are interactive would be very useful.

All three maps work well on laptops, desktop computer devices, 

Overall, the project is well informed and put together. I feel as though it does a great job of teaching one about the musical influences enslaved peoples had on history both abroad and in the New World.
