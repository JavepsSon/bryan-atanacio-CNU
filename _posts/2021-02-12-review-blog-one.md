## Summary

_Placing Segregation_ is a journey through the 1860s-70s in the three major cities of Washington, Omaha, and Nashville. Dr. Shephard has dedicated time and extremely accurate historical census data to better study, understand, and preserve the culture of multiple minority group communities. Through extensive research into the historical census data of early America, Dr. Shephard and his associates have gathered information about every person within those three major city areas including occupation, age, gender, et.. The directors’ purpose for the project is to create a resource for historical inquiry that enables immediate analysis of the particular areas of interest. 

## Design Methods

The project site design was built using coding languages of HTML, CSS, Javascript and text-based GeoJSON, and the library Leaflet.js. The usage of these tools optimizes the reader's experience on laptops, desktop computer devices, and mobile devices such as cellphones and tablets. The site allows for the reader to view and analyze three major communities in a digital format that help them feel like they are in the 1860s-70s era.

## Importance

The project does an excellent job of utilizing historical documentation and technology to better analyze the recorded census of the time period. The project’s director is proficient in the field of geography and historical record-keeping, two areas of expertise that make up core of the project’s findings. The information presented within these maps shows the level of research about the topic by presenting accurate historical data that traces back several decades within an interactive map. The directors offer contact information in which you can get into contact with them about further research and questions on the project.

## Credentials

In its Methods section, the project director explains that the basis for all of the data for the maps came from census information from the 1860s-70s. Any families or homes that did not have accurate listings were assumed based on the "address information" for the time period.

## Review

Placing Segregation does an excellent job of merging history and technology in a user-friendly way. I enjoyed the ease of access that three maps presented in the blog gave to me as a viewer. However, I did find the "Home" page to leave more to be desired as it felt very minimalistic with only links to the three maps. Having more information about what the blog's intent is could elevate the level of research and professionalism that is presented within the maps. The "About" section of the blog gave much information about the project as a whole and why it was made, but it could use some images to better separate the wall of text. 

All three maps work well on laptops, desktop computer devices, 

Overall, the project is well informed and put together. I feel as though it does a great job of teaching one about the musical influences enslaved peoples had on history both abroad and in the New World.
